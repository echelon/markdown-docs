My problem was **over-enginnering**: I needed to design the platform, the 
network aspects, data ontologies, a triplestore (then a quad store), and worst
of all a new kind of graphical interface. Then I imagined a semantic-MVC layer 
that would allow people to work with individual interactions within the graph,
and on and on... it got absurd. 

TODO...
